This project involves full-stack development. I utilized Figma for prototyping and wireframing each component and page of the website. The original design was outdated and required a revamp, so I designed and then developed a working prototype by incorporating new techniques learned from "Responsive Web Design with HTML5 and CSS - Fourth Edition" by Ben Frain. It was one of the most influential works on my web development process, providing valuable insights and techniques that helped me improve my skills. I then integrated a database and server into the prototype using MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.js, with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript."
